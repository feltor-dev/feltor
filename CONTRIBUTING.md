## Contributions are welcome

We are always happy when you are interested in the code or want to
contribute. Currently we use the
[fork and pull](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/) type of collaboration. Contributions are possible by making a
[pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to
the official [feltor-dev/feltor](https://www.github.com/feltor-dev/feltor)
master branch. This means you have to fork the feltor-dev/feltor
repository. When you make a pull-request we will review the code and may
require changes before your code is merged into the official branch. If
you don't feel comfortable, you can always create a pull-request to
[mwiesenberger/feltor](https://www.github.com/mwiesenberger/feltor) or
[mrheld/feltor](https://www.github.com/mrheld/feltor) to get some advice
or help on your code before going for the official branch. We only have
one rule:

* *The master branch on feltor-dev/feltor must always be as stable and
correct as possible*

You can do whatever you want in your own repository but a suggestion
would be to use something similar to the
[github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Some time ago
we also tried the
[GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) but we
find that it is unnecessarily complex and causes much confusion.

## Readability and Documentation

When you contribute code it is important to us that your code is
readable. As a rule of thumb you should be able to easily figure out
what the code is doing even after you haven't looked at it for a month
or two. Simple code is less error-prone and easy to use.

When you contribute new dg library functions or clases we require you to
document them with Doxygen, for others to know what the function/class
is supposed to do. When you work on a new physical project or
diagnostics you should write a technical documentation on the program(s)
with LateX and upload it if you decide to make your project available in
the official repository. Please find the workflow associated with the
documentation in the following graph:

## Legal stuff

When you make a pull-request to the feltor-dev/feltor repository you
agree to put your code under the MIT license. You will be automatically
listed as a contributor to the code on the website. If you want to use a
different license for your own contributions, please contact us. In your
own fork/copy of the code the MIT License gives you great freedom in
what you do. In fact, you can practically do whatever you please. The
only thing you must do is to name us (Matthias Wiesenberger and Markus
Held) as creators.
