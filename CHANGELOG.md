# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

We mark updates with a (pre-)release tag on
github.
> Creating a release on github will create an associated archived version
  on zenodo.

As of v8.0 we try to follow [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) i.e. major version number changes break backwards compatibility and minor version number changes indicate new features. Before that we kind of made up our own version numbers. A new major version number is often associated with a journal publication, but other than that there is no defined mapping from the amount or kind of change to a version number.

> Only changes in code are reported here, we do not track changes in the
> doxygen documentation, READMEs or tex writeups.
> As of v7.0 we also stop reporting changes in test and benchmark programs.

 - json utility functions `dg::file::file2Json`, and `dg::file::string2Json` in json_utilities.h which adds a small abstraction layer that gives a user more control over what happens if an error happens during the parsing of a file
 - "easy output" netcdf utility functions that are particularly useful for MPI output: either write data in parallel or funnel through the master thread

 - new class `dg::EVE` that computes the largest Eigenvalue of a matrix (courtesy of Eduard Reiter)
 - new class `dg::ChebyshevIterations` and `dg::ChebyshevPreconditioner` (for chebyshev iterations)
 - new solvers `dg::LGMRES`, `dg::BICGSTABL`, and d`g::AndersonAcceleration` (courtesy of Aslak Poulsen)

### Changed
 - namespace file changed to **dg::file** and exblas changed to **dg::exblas** (for consistency reasons, everything should go into the dg namespace, which in particular reduces the chance for name-clashes to just one, namely 'dg')
 - Moved **variation** member function into **dg::Elliptic** (previously in ArakawaX and Poisson)
 - **std=c++14** We use the C++-14 standard now (previously 11)

 - changed name `dg::forward_transform` function (previously `dg::create::forward_transform`)
 - new `dg::geo::MagneticFieldParameters` struct to unify the representation of Meta-data in the `dg::geo::TokamakMagneticField` class (simplifies construction)

### Deprecated
- dg::blas1::transfer (replaced by the more general dg::assign and dg::construct)

  unified access and easier recognition as a dg header file)

- src/asela and src/asela2d (now merged into src/feltor and src/feltor2d)
- src/feltor2D (now merged in src/feltor project as an input parameter)
- src/feltor/feltor.cu (not really useful any more with our adatpive
  Timesteppers as we don't need to find suitable timesteps anymore)
- src/feltor/feltor\_mpi.cu (now merged into feltor\_hpc.cu)
- BinaryFunctorAdapter and aCloneableBinaryFunctor ( we now use the better
  CylindricalFunctor based on std::function to do the type erasure)
- TensorElliptic, GeneralElliptic and GeneralEllipticSym classes ( superceded by Elliptic3d)
- inc/geometries/ds\_geom\_t.cu and ds\_guenther\_b.cu (superceded by better test programs)
