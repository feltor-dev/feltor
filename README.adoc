FELTOR (Full-F ELectromagnetic code in TORoidal geometry) is a modular scientific software package used for:

- Physics: study fluid models for magnetised (fusion) plasmas in one, two and three dimensions
- Numerics: develop and study numerical methods for these models in particular novel discontinuous Galerkin methods and structured grid generators
- High performance computing: investigate parallel peformance, binary reproducibility and accuracy of the above algorithms on modern hardware architectures.

FELTOR applications are platform independent and run on a large variety of hardware from laptop CPUs to GPUs to high performance compute clusters.

== 1. Quick start guide [[sec_quickstart]]
This guide discusses how to setup, build, test and benchmark FELTOR on a given system. Please read it before you proceed to the https://feltor-dev.github.io/user-guide[user guide] to learn how to use the library in your own programs.

=== System Setup using CMake
The first step is to clone and configure the FELTOR repository from GitHub.
[source,sh]
----
git clone https://www.github.com/feltor-dev/feltor
cd feltor
cmake --preset cpu # or gpu, omp, mpi-cpu, mpi-gpu, mpi-omp
----
You may need to install the external dependencies `libnetcdf-dev`, `liblapack-dev` and `libboost-dev` (and `libglfw3-dev` for OpenGL output and `libopenmpi-dev` for MPI support) from your system package manager.
____
On Windows you can use the built-in git client and cmake integration of Visual Studio. It is easiest to use the built-in vcpkg manager to install the `netcdf-c`, `glfw3`, `lapack` and `boost-headers` dependencies.
____

There are 6 presets targeting 6 different hardware architectures. All require the C{plus}{plus}-17 standard. Each preset `X` creates its binary directory `build/X`.

.System requirements [[tab_requirements]]
[cols='3,10,14',options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| CMake Preset  | Requirements | Description
| *cpu*     | gcc >= 9 or msvc >= 19 or icc >= 19.0 or clang >= 19        |Single core CPU, no parallelization; support for AVX and FMA instruction set is recommended
| *omp* | OpenMP-4 support| Multi-core CPU parallelisation, set OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable to set number of OpenMP threads to run. Not currently available on Windows with MSVC!
| *gpu*    |   nvcc >= 11.0 | Parallel computation on a single NVidia GPU
| *mpi-cpu*     | MPI version 3 | Distributed memory system for pure MPI parallelisation
| *mpi-omp*| MPI version 3 | Hybrid MPI + OpenMP parallelisation. In this configuration you may want to investigate how OpenMP threads map to CPU cores. Not currently available on Windows with MSVC!
| *mpi-gpu*| MPI version 3, ideally CUDA aware| Hybrid MPI + GPU parallelisation. Each MPI thread targets one GPU.
|=======================================================================

____
Our GPU backend uses the
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone[Nvidia-CUDA] programming
environment and in order to compile and run a program for a GPU a user
needs the nvcc compiler and a NVidia
GPU. However, we explicitly note here that due to the modular design of
our software a user does not have to possess a GPU nor the nvcc
compiler. The CPU version of the backend is equally valid and provides
the same functionality. Analogously, an MPI installation is only required if the user targets
a distributed memory system.
____
=== Available targets
The Feltor projects defines a host of CMake targets that can be
built after configuration. To build everything run
[source,sh]
----
cmake --build build/cpu -j 4
 # Replace "cpu" with the preset of your choice; here and in the following.
 # -j 4 activates parallel compilation with 4 threads.
----
The Feltor CMake targets are organised into three categories: tests, benchmarks and production projects. These
can be targeted individually using
[source,sh]
----
cmake --build build/cpu --target dg_tests -j 4
# Compile all tests of the dg library
cmake --build build/cpu --target dg_benchmarks -j 4
# Compile all benchmarks of the dg library
cmake --build build/cpu --target feltor_projects -j 4
# Compile all production projects of feltor
----
The tests will be built in the `build/X/tests` the benchmarks
in `build/X/benchmarks` and the projects in `build/X/src`, where `X` is the preset in use.
The tests can be run using
[source,sh]
----
ctest --test-dir build/cpu
----

Lastly, one can also target individual programs. All programs in the dg library start with the prefix `dg_` followed by the component name `backend`, `topology`, `geometries`, `file` or `matrix` followed by the program name without suffix. The feltor project targets follow the naming scheme `project_target` where `project` is the name of the folder in the `src` directory and `target` is the program name without suffix. The output name in the binary directory follows the original folder structure and program name. For example:
[source,sh]
----
cmake --build build/cpu --target dg_blas_b
./build/cpu/benchmarks/blas_b
# Compile and run the benchmark program feltor/inc/dg/blas_b.cpp
cmake --build build/cpu --target dg_topology_derivatives_t
./build/cpu/tests/topology/derivatives_t
# Compile and run the test program feltor/inc/dg/topology/derivatives_t.cpp
cmake --build build/cpu --target feltor_feltor
./build/cpu/src/feltor/feltor
# Compile and run the 3d feltor code in feltor/src/feltor/feltor.cpp
----
Again, remember to replace `cpu` with the preset of your choice and mind the various options when running parallel programs, e.g.
[source,sh]
----
cmake --preset gpu
cmake --build build/gpu --target dg_blas_b
./build/gpu/benchmarks/blas_b
# Compile and run the benchmark program feltor/inc/dg/blas_b.cpp for GPU
cmake --preset omp
cmake --build build/omp --target dg_blas_b
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
./build/gpu/benchmarks/blas_b
# Compile and run the benchmark program feltor/inc/dg/blas_b.cpp for OpenMP
cmake --preset mpi-cpu
cmake --build build/mpi-cpu --target feltor_feltor
mpirun -n 4 ./build/mpi-cpu/src/feltor/feltor
# Compile and run the 3d feltor code in feltor/src/feltor/feltor.cpp for pure MPI using 4 MPI threads
----
=== Using FELTOR's dg library in CMake

FELTOR contains a library called the *dg-library* (from discontinuous Galerkin). To integrate FELTOR's dg library in your own project via cmake currently the only option is to add it as a submodule i.e. either (i) use https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html[FetchContent] directly or (ii) use the cmake package manager https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake[CPM] (our recommendation) or (iii) add feltor as a git submodule and use `add_subdirectory` in your `CMakeLists.txt`. We here show the CPM version. To get started follow the CPM quick start guide to setup the file `cmake/CPM.cmake`. It is also highly recommended to set the `CPM_SOURCE_CACHE` environment variable.
____
CMake's install rules and `find_package` currently does not work well with targets that can be compiled for various languages (see https://github.com/feltor-dev/feltor/issues/59[this issue])
____
The available library targets in cmake are of the format `feltor::dg::component`, where `component` is one of the following:

.Feltor's dg library targets `feltor::dg::component`
[cols='3,10,14',options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| component  | Corresponding Header | Description
| `dg`    | `dg/algorithm.h`        |Depends on https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl[cccl] and https://github.com/vectorclass/version2[vectorclass] (loaded via `CPMAddPackage`)
| `geometries` | `dg/geometries/geometries.h`| Depends on `feltor::dg::file::json`
| `matrix`   |  `dg/matrix/matrix.h` | Depends on `liblapack-dev` and `libboost-dev`
| `file`    | `dg/file/file.h` | Depends on `feltor::dg::file::json` and `feltor::dg::file::netcdf`
| `file::json`| `dg/file/json_utilities.h` | Depends on either `nlohmann_json >= 3.11` (default) or `jsoncpp >= 1.9.5` (setting `FELTOR_FILE_WITH_JSONCPP ON`) via `CPMAddPackage`
| `file::netcdf`| `dg/file/nc_utilities.h`| Depends on `libnetcdf-dev`.
|=======================================================================

____
As noted before you may need to install the external dependencies `libnetcdf-dev`, `liblapack-dev` and `libboost-dev` from your system package manager (or use e.g. the vcpkg manager to install  `netcdf-c`, `lapack` and `boost-headers`). Note that you can set the options `FELTOR_DG_WITH_MATRIX OFF` and `FELTOR_FILE_WITH_NETCDF OFF` to avoid having to install netcdf, lapack or boost.
____

Furthermore, since feltor's dg library depends on cccl, we inherit their option `CCCL_THRUST_DEVICE_SYSTEM`, which can be either `CPP`, `OMP` or `CUDA`. Since with CUDA a new language must be enabled (which can only be done once in a cmake project) we must add this to the cmake file:

.CMakeLists.txt
[source,cmake]
----
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.26)
project( myProject
    VERSION         1.0.0
    LANGUAGES       CXX
)
# We need to enable CUDA language if the user wants it
if(CCCL_THRUST_DEVICE_SYSTEM STREQUAL "CUDA" OR CCCL_THRUST_DEVICE_SYSTEM STREQUAL "")
    enable_language(CUDA)
    set_source_files_properties(main.cpp PROPERTIES LANGUAGE CUDA)
endif()

include(cmake/CPM)

CPMAddPackage(
    NAME feltor
    GITHUB_REPOSITORY "feltor-dev/feltor"
    VERSION 8.2
    SYSTEM ON
    EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL ON
    OPTIONS "FELTOR_DG_WITH_MATRIX OFF" "FELTOR_FILE_WITH_NETCDF OFF"
)
add_executable(main main.cpp)
# The base dg library header "dg/algorithm.h"
target_link_libraries( main PRIVATE feltor::dg::dg)
----

Note
that the dg library is **header-only**, which means that you just have to
include the relevant header(s) and you're good to go. For example in the
following program we compute the square L2 norm of a
function:

.main.cpp [[main_cpp]]
[source,c++]
----
#include <iostream>
//include the basic dg-library
#include "dg/algorithm.h"

double function(double x, double y){return exp(x)*exp(y);}
int main()
{
    //create a 2d discretization of [0,2]x[0,2] with 3 polynomial coefficients
    dg::CartesianGrid2d g2d( 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 20, 20);
    //discretize a function on this grid
    const dg::DVec x = dg::evaluate( function, g2d);
    //create the volume element
    const dg::DVec vol2d = dg::create::volume( g2d);
    //compute the square L2 norm on the device
    double norm = dg::blas2::dot( x, vol2d, x);
    // norm is now: (exp(4)-exp(0))^2/4
    std::cout << norm <<std::endl;
    return 0;
}
----

To compile and run this code for a GPU use

[source,sh]
----
cmake -Bbuild/gpu -DCCCL_THRUST_DEVICE_SYTEM="CUDA" -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="native" -DCMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS="-march=native -O3"
cmake --build build/gpu
./build/gpu/main
----

Or if you want to use OpenMP and gcc instead of CUDA for the device
functions you can also use

[source,sh]
----
cmake -Bbuild/omp -DCCCL_THRUST_DEVICE_SYTEM="OMP" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native -O3"
cmake --build build/omp
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
./build/omp/main
----
If you do not want any parallelization, you can use a single thread version
[source,sh]
----
cmake -Bbuild/omp -DCCCL_THRUST_DEVICE_SYTEM="CPP" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native -O3"
cmake --build build/cpu
./build/cpu/main
----

If you want to use mpi, just include the MPI header before any other
FELTOR header and use our convenient typedefs like so:

.main.cpp
[source,c++]
----
#include <iostream>
#ifdef WITH_MPI
//activate MPI in FELTOR
#include "mpi.h"
#endif
#include "dg/algorithm.h"

double function(double x, double y){return exp(x)*exp(y);}
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
#ifdef WITH_MPI
    //init MPI and create a 2d Cartesian Communicator assuming 4 MPI threads
    MPI_Init( &argc, &argv);
    int periods[2] = {true, true}, np[2] = {2,2};
    MPI_Comm comm;
    MPI_Cart_create( MPI_COMM_WORLD, 2, np, periods, true, &comm);
#endif
    //create a 2d discretization of [0,2]x[0,2] with 3 polynomial coefficients
    dg::CartesianMPIGrid2d g2d( 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 20, 20
#ifdef WITH_MPI
    , comm
#endif
    );
    //discretize a function on this grid
    const dg::x::DVec x = dg::evaluate( function, g2d);
    //create the volume element
    const dg::x::DVec vol2d = dg::create::volume( g2d);
    //compute the square L2 norm
    double norm = dg::blas2::dot( x, vol2d, x);
    //on every thread norm is now: (exp(4)-exp(0))^2/4
#ifdef WITH_MPI
    //be a good MPI citizen and clean up
    MPI_Finalize();
#endif
    return 0;
}
----
The CMake file needs to be modified like

.CMakeLists.txt
[source,cmake]
----
option(MAIN_WITH_MPI "Compile main with MPI parallelisation" OFF)
if(MAIN_WITH_MPI)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE MPI::MPI_CXX)
    target_compile_definitions(main PRIVATE WITH_MPI)
endif()
----

Compile e.g. for a hybrid MPI {plus} OpenMP hardware platform with

[source,sh]
----
cmake -Bbuild/mpi-omp -DCCCL_THRUST_DEVICE_SYTEM="OMP" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native -O3" -DMAIN_WITH_MPI=ON
cmake --build build/mpi-omp
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
mpirun -n 4 ./build/mpi-omp/main
----
This will run 4 MPI threads with 2 OpenMP threads each.

Note the striking similarity to the previous program. Especially the
line calling the dot function did not change at all. The compiler
chooses the correct implementation for you! This is a first example of __platform independent code__.


=== Using Makefiles (Deprecated)

Open a terminal and clone the repository into any folder you like

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://www.github.com/feltor-dev/feltor
----

You also need to clone https://github.com/nvidia/cccl[cccl]
 distributed under the
Apache-2.0 license. Also, we need Agner Fog's https://github.com/vectorclass/version1[vcl] library (Apache 2.0). So again in a folder of your choice

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://www.github.com/nvidia/cccl
git clone https://www.github.com/vectorclass/version2 vcl
----

____
Our code only depends on external libraries that are themselves openly
available.
If version2 of the vectorclass library does not work for you, you can also try version1.
____



==== Running a FELTOR test or benchmark program

In order to compile one of the many test and benchmark codes
inside the FELTOR library you need to tell
the FELTOR configuration where the external libraries are located on
your computer. The default way to do this is to go into your `HOME`
directory, make an include directory and link the paths in this
directory

[source,sh]
----
cd ~
mkdir include
cd include
ln -s path/to/cccl/thrust/thrust # Yes, thrust is there twice!
ln -s path/to/cccl/cub/cub
ln -s path/to/cccl/libcudacxx/include/cuda
ln -s path/to/cccl/libcudacxx/include/nv
ln -s path/to/vcl
----

____
If you do not like this, you can also set the include paths in your own config file as
described link:config/README.md[here].
____

Now let us compile the first benchmark program.

[source,sh]
----
cd path/to/feltor/inc/dg

make blas_b device=cpu #(for a single thread CPU version)
#or
make blas_b device=omp #(for an OpenMP version)
#or
make blas_b device=gpu #(if you have a GPU and nvcc )
----

Run the code with

[source,sh]
----
./blas_b
----

and when prompted for input vector sizes type for example `3 100 100 10`
which makes a grid with 3 polynomial coefficients, 100 cells in x, 100
cells in y and 10 in z. If you compiled for OpenMP, you can set the
number of threads with e.g. `export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4`.
____
This is a
benchmark program to benchmark various elemental functions the library
is built on. Go ahead and vary the input parameters and see how your
hardware performs. You can compile and run any other program that ends
in `_t.cu` (test programs) or `_b.cu` (benchmark programs) in
`feltor/inc/dg` in this way.
____

Now, let us test the mpi setup
____
You can of course skip this if you
don't have mpi installed on your computer. If you intend to use the
MPI backend, an implementation library of the mpi standard is required.
Per default `mpic++` is used for compilation.
____

[source,sh]
----
cd path/to/feltor/inc/dg

make blas_mpib device=cpu  # (for MPI+CPU)
# or
make blas_mpib device=omp  # (for MPI+OpenMP)
# or
make blas_mpib device=gpu # (for MPI+GPU, requires CUDA-aware MPI installation)
----

Run the code with `$ mpirun -n '# of procs' ./blas_mpib` then tell how
many process you want to use in the x-, y- and z- direction, for
example: `2 2 1` (i.e. 2 procs in x, 2 procs in y and 1 in z; total
number of procs is 4) when prompted for input vector sizes type for
example `3 100 100 10` (number of cells divided by number of procs must
be an integer number). If you compiled for MPI{plus}OpenMP, you can set the
number of OpenMP threads with e.g. `export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2`.




==== Running a FELTOR simulation

Now, we want to compile and run a simulation program. To this end, we have to
download and install some additional libraries for I/O-operations.

First, we need to install jsoncpp (distributed under the MIT License),
which on linux is available as `libjsoncpp-dev` through the package managment system.
For a manual build check the instructions on https://www.github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp[JsonCpp].
[source,sh]
----
# You may have to manually link the include path
cd ~/include
ln -s /usr/include/jsoncpp/json
----

For data output we use the
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/[NetCDF-C] library under an
MIT - like license (we use the netcdf-4 file format).
The underlying https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/[HDF5]
library also uses a very permissive license.
Both can be installed easily on Linux through the `libnetcdf-dev` and `libhdf5-dev` packages.
For a manual build follow the build instructions in the https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/getting_and_building_netcdf.html[netcdf-documentation].
Note that by default we use the serial netcdf and hdf5 libraries alson in the mpi
versions of applications.

Some desktop applications in FELTOR use the
https://github.com/mwiesenberger/draw[draw library] (developed by us
also under MIT), which depends on
http://www.glfw.org[glfw3], an OpenGL development library under a
BSD-like license. There is a `libglfw3-dev` package for convenient installation. Again, link `path/to/draw` in the `include` folder.

____
If you are on a HPC cluster, you may need to set INCLUDE and LIB variables manually.
For details on how FELTOR's Makefiles are configured please see the link:config/README.md[config] file. There are also examples of some existing Makefiles in the same folder.
____

We are now ready to compile and run a simulation program

[source,sh]
----
cd path/to/feltor/src/toefl # or any other project in the src folder

make toefl device=gpu     # (compile for gpu, cpu or omp)
cp input/default.json inputfile.json # create an inputfile
./toefl inputfile.json    # (behold a live simulation with glfw output on screen)
# or
make toefl_hpc device=gpu  # (compile for gpu, cpu or omp)
cp input/default_hpc.json inputfile_hpc.json # create an inputfile
./toefl_hpc inputfile_hpc.json outputfile.nc # (a single node simulation with output stored in a file)
# or
make toefl_mpi device=omp  # (compile for gpu, cpu or omp)
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2   # (set OpenMP thread number to 1 for pure MPI)
echo 2 2 | mpirun -n 4 ./toefl_mpi inputfile_hpc.json outputfile.nc
# (a multi node simulation with now in total 8 threads with output stored in a file)
# The mpi program will wait for you to type the number of processes in x and y direction before
# running. That is why the echo is there.
----

Default input files are located in `path/to/feltor/src/toefl/input`. All
three programs solve the same equations. The technical documentation on
what equations are discretized, input/output parameters, etc. can be
generated as a pdf with `make doc` in the `path/to/feltor/src/toefl`
directory.




== 2. Documentation

The
https://mwiesenberger.github.io/feltor/dg/html/topics.html[documentation]
of the dg library was generated with
http://www.doxygen.org[Doxygen]. You can generate a local
version directly from source code. This depends on the `doxygen`,
`libjs-mathjax`, `graphviz` and `doxygen-awesome` packages. Type `make doc` in
the folder `path/to/feltor/doc` and open `index.html` (a symbolic link
to `dg/html/modules.html`) with your favorite browser.
Finally, also note the documentations of https://nvidia.github.io/cccl/thrust[thrust].

We maintain tex files in every src folder for
technical documentation, which can be compiled using pdflatex with
`make doc` in the respective src folder.
